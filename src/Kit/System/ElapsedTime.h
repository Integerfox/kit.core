/** This class defines the interface for accessing the elapsed time since power
    up and/or reset of the platform.  Elapsed time has millisecond precision.
    Elapsed time is kept in a free running counter - which will roll
    over after its data type has been exceeded

    There are two set of methods for accessing elapsed time:
    1. The default 'API' that uses uint32_t to represent elapsed time.  The
       32bit counter rolls over after 49.7 days.
    2. Extended 'API' that uses a 64bit data type to represent elapsed time.
       The 64bit counter rolls over after 584 million years.

    NOTE: The two APIs share the same underlying timing source, i.e. the returned
          values are 'in-sync'
