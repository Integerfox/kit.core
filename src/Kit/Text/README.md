# Kit::Text
@brief namespace description for Kit::Text
@namespace Kit::Text @brief

The Text namespace provides yet-another String class and additional string and/or text processing utilities.  

What makes the `Kit::Text::IString` classes different from other String classes
is that it supports a ZERO dynamic memory allocation interface and implementation.
There is also a dynamic memory implementation of the IString interface for when
strict memory management is not required.
